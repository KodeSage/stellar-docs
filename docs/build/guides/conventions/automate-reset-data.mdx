## Overview

Stellar operates two primary testing environments: the Testnet and the Futurenet. These networks allow developers to experiment with Stellar features without risking real assets. Periodically, these networks are reset to ensure they remain clean and manageable.

## What is the Testnet and Futurenet Reset?

Testnet and Futurenet are reset periodically to the genesis ledger to declutter the network, remove spam, reduce the time needed to catch up on the latest ledger, and help maintain the system. Resets clear all ledger entries (accounts, trustlines, offers, smart contract data, etc.), transactions, and historical data from Stellar Core, Horizon, and the Soroban RPC- which is why developers should not rely on the persistence of accounts or the state of any balances when using Testnet or Futurenet.
